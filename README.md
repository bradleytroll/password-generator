## How it Works

The password generation is based on user preferences, allowing them to select the length and character types for their password. The length can be between 8-128 characters, and the character types include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerals, and special characteres. The generator then combines the selected character sets and randomly selects characters to create a strong and secure password.
